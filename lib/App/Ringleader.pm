package App::Ringleader;
# ABSTRACT: Proxy for sproradically-used web application

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::Ringleader;

    App::Ringleader->new( conf => 'ringleader.yml' )->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ringleader is a proxy that will wake up psgi applications upon request 
and shut them down after a period of inactivity. It's meant to provide a
middle-ground between the slowliness of CGI and the constant resource
consumption of plack applications for services that are not often used.

Typically, you'll use it via the C<ringleader> script.

Ringleader relies on L<Ubic> to start and stop the services. For PSGI
applications, you probably want to define your services using
L<Ubic::Service::Plack>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The Ringleader configuration file is YAML-based, and looks like

    port: 3000
    inactivity_delay: 60
    services:
        techblog.babyl.ca:  webapp.techblog
        kittenwar.babyl.ca: webapp.kittenwar
    CHI:
        driver: FastMmap

=head2 port

The port of the proxy. Defaults to I<3000>.


=head2 inactivity_delay

The minimum time (in minutes) of inactivity before a service will be shut down.

Defaults to 60 minutes.

=head2 services

The services Ringleader will monitor. Each service is configured via a
key/value pair. The key is the request's host, and the value is the 
<Ubic> service it related to.

=head2 CHI

The arguments to pass to L<CHI> to build the caching system used
by the service. If not provided, L<CHI::Driver::FastMmap> will be used.
